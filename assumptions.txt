- All bus routes will have its final destination be a school
- Each bus route is specific to each school (i.e. a bus route cannot be for two schools)
- The latitude/longitude coordinates used translate to 111km/degree

- Buses travel at a constant speed between points
- We are not concerned about the starting location/time of buses, nor is bus supply a concern (problem becomes scheduling)
